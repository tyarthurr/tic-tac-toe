# Description
Tic-Tac-Toe as a terminal game with singleplayer (player vs computer, using a PRNG) and multiplayer (player vs player) modes. The beginning stages of the project had already been completed before deciding to use Git integration with Visual Studio for version control.

# What did I learn
First C++ project and first project using Git integration with Visual Studio - putting the theory of both into structured practice (for a full project) for the first time was in itself a major learning experience. Some additional major learning points: modifying specific chars in a string, the differences in behaviour between an if-else statement and a switch case, bool variables can be initialised with the presence of a complex condition (resulting in a boolean value), when the use of pointers is useful from the perspective of memory allocation, how to use PRNG algorithms properly and with system time as a seed, and when to use Git branches.
